Bypass the need for bluetooth - Use a second tinytile as a serial to bluetooth bridge for use with the HeatSync Labs Nodebots Day nodebots. 

Though I started making just a direct bridge, I quickly just wrote a translator for more abstracted moves not related to the individual pins. This probably bypasses the whole need for node.js (but that's fine with me)
